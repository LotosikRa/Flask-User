This fork was created because of original repository updates not so regular.

Warning

I'm trying to not break backward compatibility, but I have decided to replace PyCrypto with PyCryptodome.

Branches
--------

* **mod** - this fork's `master`
* **new** - this fork's `develop`
* **modern** - merge of `mod` and `master`
